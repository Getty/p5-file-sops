=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::SOPS::Encrypted;

    # Parse an encrypted value string
    my $enc = File::SOPS::Encrypted->parse(
        'ENC[AES256_GCM,data:xyz,iv:abc,tag:def,type:str]'
    );

    # Check if a string is encrypted
    if (File::SOPS::Encrypted->is_encrypted($string)) {
        my $decrypted = $enc->decrypt_value(key => $data_key, aad => $path);
    }

    # Encrypt a value
    my $enc = File::SOPS::Encrypted->encrypt_value(
        value => 'secret',
        key   => $data_key,
        aad   => 'database:password',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::SOPS::Encrypted handles parsing and generation of SOPS encrypted value
strings. Each encrypted value in a SOPS file is represented as:

    ENC[AES256_GCM,data:base64,iv:base64,tag:base64,type:str]

Values are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using:

=over 4

=item * A shared data key (32 bytes, encrypted separately for each recipient)

=item * A random initialization vector (IV) per value (32 bytes -- see L</iv>)

=item * Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) derived from the value's path

=item * Type preservation (str, int, float, bool, bytes)

=back

=cut

has algorithm => (is => 'ro', default => 'AES256_GCM');

=attr algorithm

Encryption algorithm. Currently only C<AES256_GCM> is supported. Defaults to C<AES256_GCM>.

=cut

has data => (is => 'ro', required => 1);

=attr data

Encrypted ciphertext as raw bytes. Required.

=cut

has iv => (is => 'ro', required => 1);

=attr iv

Initialization vector (IV) as raw bytes, B<32 bytes>. Required.

Note that this is deliberately B<not> the conventional 12-byte (96-bit) AES-GCM
nonce. The SOPS reference implementation generates a 32-byte nonce and builds
its cipher with Go's C<cipher.NewGCMWithNonceSize>, so 32 bytes is part of the
on-the-wire format rather than a choice this module is free to make. AES-GCM
derives its initial counter block differently for non-96-bit nonces (the nonce
is folded through GHASH instead of being used directly), which means an IV of a
different length does not merely look unusual -- it produces a value the Go
implementation cannot authenticate, and vice versa.

C<encrypt_value> generates 32 random bytes accordingly. Do not "correct" this
to 12.

=cut

has tag => (is => 'ro', required => 1);

=attr tag

Authentication tag as raw bytes, 16 bytes for AES-GCM. Required.

=cut

has type => (is => 'ro', default => 'str');

=attr type

Original value type for deserialization. One of: C<str>, C<int>, C<float>, C<bool>, C<bytes>.

Defaults to C<str>.

=method parse

    my $enc = File::SOPS::Encrypted->parse($string);
    # Returns undef if $string is not encrypted

Parses a SOPS encrypted value string.

Takes a string like C<ENC[AES256_GCM,data:...,iv:...,tag:...,type:str]> and
returns a File::SOPS::Encrypted object with decoded attributes.

Returns C<undef> if the string is not in the encrypted format.

    }

Class method to check if a string is in SOPS encrypted format.

Returns true if the string matches the C<ENC[...]> pattern.

Serializes the encrypted value to SOPS string format.

Returns a string representation with base64-encoded components.

=method encrypt_value

        value => 'secret',
        key   => $data_key,        # 32 bytes
        aad   => 'database:password',  # Additional Authenticated Data
        type  => 'str',            # optional, auto-detected
    );

Class method to encrypt a value.

Encrypts a scalar value using AES-256-GCM with a random IV. Returns a
File::SOPS::Encrypted object.

The C<aad> (Additional Authenticated Data) is typically the path to the value
in the data structure (e.g., C<database:password:>), used to prevent value
substitution attacks.

Both C<value> and C<aad> are encoded to UTF-8 before they reach the cipher,
which is what the Go implementation authenticates against, but by two
deliberately different rules:

=over 4

=item * C<aad> is B<always> encoded. It names a key that the format handler
writes to the file with C<YAML::XS::Dump> or C<JSON::MaybeXS(utf8 =E<gt> 1)>,
and both of those encode a key to UTF-8 regardless of Perl's UTF-8 flag. The
AAD has to say what the emitter wrote, or a document fails its own MAC on the
next read.

=item * C<value> is encoded only if it carries the UTF-8 flag, so a caller
handing over UTF-8 bytes rather than characters still writes the bytes it
meant. Nothing outside this call has to agree on the plaintext -- the
ciphertext and the MAC are both taken over exactly these bytes.

=back

Type is auto-detected from the value if not specified, by L</detect_type>.

Passing C<type> explicitly overrides the B<label> only, never the bytes: those
always come from what the value is. C<encrypt_value(value =E<gt> '007', type
=E<gt> 'int')> writes the label C<int> and the plaintext C<007>, because a
Perl string is written verbatim. That is how you reproduce a document some
other producer wrote; it is not how you write C<007> as an integer, which no
SOPS implementation does (see L</value_to_bytes>).

=cut

sub decrypt_bytes {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    my $key = $args{key} // croak "key required";
    my $aad = _aad_bytes($args{aad});

    croak "Unsupported algorithm: " . $self->algorithm
        unless $self->algorithm eq 'AES256_GCM';

    my $plaintext = gcm_decrypt_verify('AES', $key, $self->iv, $aad, $self->data, $self->tag);
    croak "Authentication failed - data may be corrupted" unless defined $plaintext;

    return $plaintext;
}

=method decrypt_bytes

    my $bytes = $enc->decrypt_bytes(
        key => $data_key,  # 32 bytes
        aad => 'database:password:',
    );

Decrypts the value and returns the authenticated plaintext B<as raw bytes>,
with no type conversion and B<no character decoding> applied.

C<aad> is UTF-8 encoded before verification by the same unconditional rule
L</encrypt_value> uses, so the two sides derive the same AAD from the same key
path however Perl happens to be storing it.

This is what the MAC is computed over. L</decrypt_value> runs the same bytes
through a type conversion (C<int()>, C<+ 0.0>, C<JSON::PP::Boolean>) whose
inverse is not exact in Perl: C<'007'> comes back as C<7>, C<'1.50'> as
C<1.5>, and the C<100000000000000000000> that Go writes for C<1e20>
restringifies as C<1e+20>. Feeding a re-serialization of the converted value
to the digest therefore produces a different hash than the one the producer
computed over the plaintext. Anything hashing a decrypted value must use this
method, not L</decrypt_value> -- the one exception being C<type:bool>, where
SOPS's C<ToBytes> titlecases whatever spelling it parsed, so the caller
normalises C<true>/C<false> to C<True>/C<False>.

Dies if authentication fails (wrong key, corrupted data, or mismatched AAD).

=cut

sub decrypt_value {
    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    return _deserialize_value($self->decrypt_bytes(%args), $self->type);
}

=method decrypt_value

    my $value = $enc->decrypt_value(
        key => $data_key,  # 32 bytes
        aad => 'database:password',
    );

Decrypts the encrypted value.

Returns the decrypted value with type conversion applied (int, float, bool
are converted to appropriate Perl types) and, for textual types, B<decoded
from UTF-8 into a character string> -- the inverse of what L</encrypt_value>
accepted. This is the Perl-facing side of the boundary; L</decrypt_bytes> is
the wire side and is what anything feeding a digest must use.

C<type:bytes> is the one exception: it is SOPS's binary type, so it is returned
as raw bytes with nothing decoded. A C<type:str> whose plaintext is not valid
UTF-8 is also returned as bytes rather than being mangled.

Dies if authentication fails (wrong key, corrupted data, or mismatched AAD).

=cut

sub detect_type {
    my ($class, $value) = @_;
    return 'str' unless defined $value;
    # JSON::PP::Boolean is the class every JSON::MaybeXS backend blesses into
    # (Cpanel::JSON::XS and JSON::XS included), and the class YAML::XS blesses
    # into under $YAML::XS::Boolean = 'JSON::PP', so this test is
    # backend-agnostic. blessed() guard: ->isa dies on an unblessed ref, and a
    # plain SCALAR/CODE ref can reach here from encrypt_value or the
    # _encrypt_tree leaf branch.
    return 'bool' if blessed($value) && $value->isa('JSON::PP::Boolean');
    return 'str'  if ref $value;

}

=method detect_type

    my $type = File::SOPS::Encrypted->detect_type($value);
    # => 'str' | 'int' | 'float' | 'bool'

Class method. Returns the SOPS type of a Perl scalar, B<from the scalar
itself> rather than from a pattern match on its text.

=over 4

=item * a L<JSON::PP::Boolean> (C<JSON-E<gt>true>, C<JSON-E<gt>false>, or a
C<true>/C<false> loaded by L<YAML::XS> or L<JSON::MaybeXS>) is C<bool>

=item * a scalar Perl holds as an integer is C<int>

=item * a scalar Perl holds as a floating point number is C<float>

=item * everything else, including every string, is C<str>

=back

This is the rule the Go implementation uses -- it takes the type from what the
YAML/JSON parser returned -- and both parsers this distribution uses preserve
the distinction, so a quoted scalar is a string end to end. Measured against
sops 3.13.3: bare C<false> is C<type:bool>, but C<"false">, C<"true">, C<"1">,
C<"0">, C<"007"> and C<"1.50"> are B<all> C<type:str>.

The corollary is that Perl's own literals decide the type for a structure
passed straight to L<File::SOPS/encrypt>: C<5432> is C<int> and C<'5432'> is
C<str>. Perl has no native boolean, so C<type:bool> needs a
L<JSON::PP::Boolean> or an explicit C<type>; the string C<'true'> is a string.

Note that Perl marks a scalar as numeric B<in place> the first time it is used
in numeric context, so C<if ($cfg-E<gt>{port} E<gt> 1024)> before encrypting
turns C<'8080'> into an C<int>. See
L<docs/adr/0002|https://github.com/Getty/p5-file-sops/blob/main/docs/adr/0002-value-type-comes-from-the-scalar-not-from-a-pattern.md>.

}

=method value_to_bytes

    my $bytes = File::SOPS::Encrypted->value_to_bytes($value);
    my $bytes = File::SOPS::Encrypted->value_to_bytes($value, $type);

Class method. Returns the wire plaintext for a value: the bytes that get
encrypted, and the bytes the MAC digest is taken over. Those are the same
bytes by definition, which is why there is one method and not two -- the
ciphertext and the digest disagreeing is this distribution's signature defect,
and it is invisible from inside Perl because both sides are then consistently
wrong.

C<$type> defaults to L</detect_type>. It selects the boolean spelling and
nothing else; the bytes always come from the value:

=over 4

=item * a boolean is C<True> or C<False> (SOPS titlecases them)

=item * an integer is its canonical decimal form -- Perl's C<0 + $value>,
which is what Go's C<strconv.Itoa> writes

=item * a float is C<strconv.FormatFloat($v, 'f', -1, 64)>: the shortest
decimal that round-trips, in positional notation and never in exponent
notation. Measured against sops 3.13.3, which stores C<1.0> as C<1>, C<1.50>
as C<1.5>, C<.5> as C<0.5> and C<1e20> as C<100000000000000000000>

=item * anything else, including every string, is written verbatim

=back

So a Perl string is never renormalised -- C<'007'> stays C<007> and C<'1.50'>
stays C<1.50> -- while a Perl number always is. A document that gets this
wrong is not merely odd-looking: Go recomputes the MAC by re-serializing the
value it parsed out of the plaintext, so C<007> stored under C<type:int>
digests as C<7> on the reading side and C<sops -d> rejects the whole file.

Character strings are UTF-8 encoded on the way out, by the same flag-guarded
rule L</encrypt_value> documents.
